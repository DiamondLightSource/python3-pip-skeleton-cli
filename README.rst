<https://blog.jaraco.com/skeleton/>`_) is a generic Python project structure
which provides a means to keep tools and techniques in sync between multiple
Python projects.

It integrates the following tools:

- pip and setuptools_scm for version management
- Pre-commit with black, flake8 and isort for static analysis
- Pytest for code and coverage
- Sphinx for tutorials, how-to guides, explanations and reference documentation
- GitHub Actions for code and docs CI and deployment to PyPI and GitHub Pages
- tox -p: runs pre-commit, pytest, mypy and make docs
  - which verifies all the things that CI does
- If you use VSCode, it will run black, flake8, isort and mypy on save

The the related skeleton_ repo for this module contains the source 
code that can be merged into new or existing projects, and pulled from to 
keep them up to date. It can also serve as a working example for those who 
would prefer to cherry-pick.
